# Teamscheire Stickers
Some sticker designs I made during/after het first season of the Belgian tv show 'team scheire'.
Team Scheire is a team of makers who solve 'everyday' problems using a combination of technology and diy skills.

## A little backstory
During the Team Scheire tv show, I felt the urge to make some art based on quotes mentioned by various makers. When the show finsihed, this is the final collection I made.
After a not-so-successful attempt to collect enough pre-orders to turn these sticker designs into real stickers throughout june / july 2019 I'm releasing all designs under a CC0 license.

Enjoy!
